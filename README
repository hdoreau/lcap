LCAP
----

LCAP stands for "Lustre Changelog Aggregate and Publish"

It consists in a core daemon (lcapd), a client library and a serie of
server-side processing modules. lcapd reads lustre 2.x Changelog records
and process them using specialized modules to distribute them (or not)
to its clients.


Installation
------------

Building lcap is relatively straightforward:

  $ ./configure
  $ make

The "rpms" target allows to build RPM packages (client, server, devel). Please
note that the existing code has been developed and tested under x86_64 only.


Running lcap
------------

Lcap comes with a testing tool suprisingly called `lcap' and wich simply reads
changelog records, similarly to what `lfs changelog'.

The client and the server can be started in any order. Whoever is started first
will wait for the other one to get online.

The lcapd server needs a configuration file. It will look for one at
/etc/lcapd.conf
This location can be overriden by using `-c' when running the server.

  $ lcapd -c /etc/lcapd.conf
